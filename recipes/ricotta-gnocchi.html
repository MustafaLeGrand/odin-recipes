    <span>Prepare for a cheesy experience filled with Italian pasta.</span>

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>3 large potatoes</li>
        <li>3 cups Ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 grated Romano cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 1/2 cups cake flour</li>
        <li>4 quarts water</li>
        <li>1/3 cup thinly sliced fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/3 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>2/3 cup crumbled Gorgonzola cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds fresh spinach, coarsely chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Scrub and pierce potatoes. Bake at 400Â° for 50-55 minutes or until tender. Peel potatoes; press through a potato ricer or strainer into a large bowl. Cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Add ricotta and Romano cheeses, oil and salt to potato pulp; beat on low speed until smooth. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time. Add flour; mix well. On a lightly floured surface, knead 10-12 times, forming a soft dough.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 16 portions. On a floured surface, roll each portion into a 1/2-in.-thick rope; cut into 3/4-in. pieces. Press and roll each piece with a lightly floured fork.</li>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, bring water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in batches until they float, 30-60 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and keep warm.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan, combine the squash, basil, water, oil, garlic, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Cover and cook until squash is tender, 4-6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in cream and Gorgonzola. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 2 minutes. Add spinach; cook until spinach is wilted. Serve with gnocchi.</li>
    </ul>
